# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.

The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

Participants are expected to:

- Respect the purpose of the community and its spaces  
- Engage kindly, honestly, and constructively with others  
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Take responsibility for their actions and contributions  
- Gracefully give and accept constructive feedback  
- Commit to repairing harm when it occurs  
- Act in ways that promote the well-being of the community

## Restricted Behaviors

The following behaviors are not permitted. Instances, threats, or promotion of these behaviors constitute violations of this Code of Conduct:

- **Character attacks**, including insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments  
- **Stereotyping or discrimination** based on immutable identities or traits

## Reporting an Issue

Disagreements may occur even when participants act in good faith. Not every conflict represents a Code of Conduct violation.

If an incident occurs that may violate this Code, please report it by contacting the project maintainers through GitHub tools, such as private issues, discussions, or GitHub Security Advisories.

Reports will be reviewed and handled in good faith, prioritizing safety and confidentiality to the extent reasonably possible.

---

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, maintainers may take actions proportionate to the incident’s impact to protect the community and restore a healthy environment.

Such actions may include warnings, temporary limitations on participation, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans in severe cases. These measures are guidelines and do not constitute legal obligations.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any official communication channels related to the project.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or community spaces.
